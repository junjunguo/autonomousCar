                    During the empathy phase, we talked to a friend of one of the team members who is a part time taxi
                    driver, and asked him what he thought of the idea of autonomous cars. His name is Mikael, and he
                    studies computer science, 5th year. When we asked him what he thought of autonomous cars he said:
                    <br/>
                    "I like the idea of autonomous cars, and I think it's the future. I realize I will be out of work
                    once it's fully incorporated into the society though."<br/><br/>
                    After discussing the topic for a while, he came to a sudden realization: <br/>
                    "...but a taxi driver's job isn't only to drive a person from one place to another. Our job is also
                    to function as a guide for the passenger, and a person who knows the local culture, and has general
                    local knowledge. Think about if
                    a drunk guy drives an autonomous taxi, but he doesn't remember where he lives for example."

                <p class="flow-text">

                    We were encouraged by our student assistant to try to observe traffic and drivers, in particularly
                    difficult intersections. Our goal was to see how drivers communicated with each other non-verbally,
                    and perhaps find patterns in the driving behaviour of different user groups. The intersections we
                    chose to observe was right next to Gløshaugen and had no traffic lights.

                        A lot of the bikers we saw were in the road, but they didn't seem to care much about the duty to
                        yield.
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        Many drivers stopped before the intersection, even though they didn't have the duty to yield.
                        Traffic-flow could be improved a lot if we all had cars which could communicate with each
                        other.

                        Elderly people spent a lot more time to ensure that it was safe to drive out onto the other
                        road.
                        One lady used almost a minute, even though there were no cars.

                    <li class="collection-item">
                        People in the passenger seat were also looking at the road for
                        passing cars.

                    <li class="collection-item">
                        Visibility in the upper inteserction was so bad, that meeting drivers always needed som form of
                        eye-contact, nods or waving, so not to crash into each other.
                    </li>
                    <li class="collection-item">
                        Saw a couple of “almost crashes” in that intersection, where both of the drivers, sometimes
                        three,
                        stopped up at first, and then began driving at the same time. Communication between the drivers
                        themselves is definitely a very important factor.

            <div>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    We drove around with some of our friends who were not familiar with the driver in order to see
                    their reactions to a new situation. One time we were driving around with Didriks friend, Eivind. He
                    explained how he was used to reckless driving, how his sister crashed the
                    family car three times and that he loved speed and acceleration. He was really calm during the first
                    twenty minutes of driving, which kind of annoyed me considering the previous passengers had been
                    more on the edge. I decided to test him in the roundabout at Moholt and on the
                    highway with high speed. He did not react. I kept on accelerating. He did not react. I had to pass a
                    couple of
                    cars in order to maintain my speed. The backseat which consisted of Didrik and Jardar who had
                    previously been asking Eivind a bunch of questions, went quiet. Eivind took notice at the speed, but
                    remained calm as Didrik made a loud remark: “We can’t afford a speeding ticket Henrikke!”.

            <div>
                <p class="flow-text">
                    We included car dealers as a stakeholder in our project, because they know a lot about the features
                    in their cars, including the autonomous ones. They talk to a lot of customers, and possible users of
                    the future autonomous cars. We interviewed both a Volvo salesman and an Audi salesman.
                    <br/><br/>
                    “The technique is there, it is just not on the market yet because the world isn’t ready yet.”
                    <br/>–Volvo Salesman
                    <br/><br/>
                    Volvo wants to let their cars communicate with the traffic lights, but the government is scared of
                    hacks and privacy issues. The new cameras for their new models are ready but will probably only be
                    introduced in 5 to 10 years, meaning people need a slow transition into these autonomous cars in
                    order to accept them.
                    <br/><br/>
                    From the Audi sales man we learned that in one of their cars it is possible to trick the car and
                    make it drive autonomously.
                    <br/><br/>
                    “I can let go of the steering wheel for a short period of time, then an alarm will go off. I tried
                    to hang a horseshoe on the steering wheel, the car accepted it and kept on driving itself.”
                    <br/>–Audi Salesman
                    <br/><br/>
                    Their cars are ready to drive themselves, but the trust and safety issue of the cars is too big.
                    Customers tend to be sceptic about the autonomous features, because they have to give up their
                    control.
                    <br/><br/>
                    We asked the salesmen if they would trust an autonomous car which was approaching them on the
                    streets. Only the Volvo salesman would trust it since he saw how the cars have been tested and
                    trusts the car brands that they won’t put a risk on the market. The other salesmen were more sceptic
                    since they believe in the human response in traffic.

                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">This course is an immersive experience into design thinkingan
                    empathy-based, human-centered, and rapid prototype-driven
                    methodology for innovation. Design thinking helps to tackle
                    challenges such as the creation of new products, technological
                    innovation, services, business models, experiences, processes and/or
                    systems.
                    <br>

                    The primary aim of the course is to empower students to ideate,
                    launch, run, and successfully complete innovation projects that have
                    a significant and meaningful impact on pioneering organizations and
                    industries.
                    <br>

                    The course encompasses intensive sessions on need finding, empathy,
                    observation, immersion, ethnographic research, brain-/body-storming,
                    ideation, and rapid prototypingall in the context of tackling
                    cutting-edge technological challenges and addressing strategic
                    industry objectives.</p>
