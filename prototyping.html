                <p class="flow-text">Sound plays an important role in an autonomous car, specially in terms of feedback.
                    During the empathising process, where we interviewed a lot of people, we found out that a lot
                    of people would feel unsafe if they did not get enough feedback in the car. They need to have
                    “control” in the car and therefore they need the car to communicate with them. Not only that,
                    but some people also want to communicate with their surroundings. The best way to fulfill these
                    requirements would be to use sounds. We think sound is an important aspect of an autonomous car
                    and therefore we chose to make a prototype of sounds.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">Like Siri in IPhone, we wanted to make a prototype of a intelligent personal
                    assistant that
                    continuously gives you feedback to the passengers inside the car. The feedback could be about
                    anything, like how much fuel you have left in your tank, whether the car is stopping for a
                    pedestrian etc. We also wanted the car to make sounds with their surroundings. For instance, when
                    the car is stopping for a pedestrian, it should say “After you sir” or something similar. That way,
                    the pedestrian would feel safe to walk over instead of freaking out by the thought that there is no
                    driver inside the car.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">To make a demonstration of this, we recorded a video. In the video, we are cutting
                    the scenes in
                    order to make the illusion of the car being an autonomous car.</p>

                    and comfortable.</p>

                <p class="flow-text">From the ideation phase we got the idea to integrate LED lights into the front of
                    the car that will communicate what the car is about to do or what the pedestrian can do.
                    A cardboard car front was built and used to make two stop motion movies that showed how the lights
                    could possibly work.

                </div>
                <p class="flow-text">This movie shows that the car is approaching a crosswalk where someone is waiting.
                    The light on the front will always be lit to show that it works. When a pedestrian is perceived it
                    will turn green, it will start braking and therefore a fluent line of red lights will ascend from
                    the middle green light showing how much the car is braking. When the car is near the crosswalk and
                    is about to completely stop the red brake lights will turn green, showing to the pedestrian it is
                    safe to walk.

                </div>
                <p class="flow-text">This movie shows the car when it is turning on an intersection. The blue light from
                    the middle will move towards, in this case, the right of the car since it is about to turn to the
                    right. The light will ‘predict’ the cars movement, by moving in advance of the car.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="flow-text">
            We showed these movies to some people, solely asking them what they think the car is communicating with them. An interesting result was that it is confusing that the car sometimes shows what the car will do and sometimes what it expects the pedestrian to do. Due to this, one participant thought that the car would start driving again after the lights turned green in the first movie, since in both movies the car is communicating what the car is doing. Also the sudden change of the colours of the light seems to confuse and shock the pedestrians. Though, the participants do believe that the lights could be a good way to show what the car will do, and therefore give them more trust in it.
            More testing about how the lights have to appear in order to communicate in an intuitive way should be conducted to create a safe concept.

                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">This course is an immersive experience into design thinkingan
                    empathy-based, human-centered, and rapid prototype-driven
                    methodology for innovation. Design thinking helps to tackle
                    challenges such as the creation of new products, technological
                    innovation, services, business models, experiences, processes and/or
                    systems.
                    <br>

                    The primary aim of the course is to empower students to ideate,
                    launch, run, and successfully complete innovation projects that have
                    a significant and meaningful impact on pioneering organizations and
                    industries.
                    <br>

                    The course encompasses intensive sessions on need finding, empathy,
                    observation, immersion, ethnographic research, brain-/body-storming,
                    ideation, and rapid prototypingall in the context of tackling
                    cutting-edge technological challenges and addressing strategic
                    industry objectives.</p>
