                <p class="flow-text">Sound plays an important role in an autonomous car, specially in terms of feedback.
                    During the empathising process, where we interviewed a lot of people, we found out that a lot
                    of people would feel unsafe if they did not get enough feedback in the car. They need to have
                    “control” in the car and therefore they need the car to communicate with them. Not only that,
                    but some people also want to communicate with their surroundings. The best way to fulfill these
                    requirements would be to use sounds. We think sound is an important aspect of an autonomous car
                    and therefore we chose to make a prototype of sounds.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">Like Siri in IPhone, we wanted to make a prototype of a intelligent personal
                    assistant that
                    continuously gives you feedback to the passengers inside the car. The feedback could be about
                    anything, like how much fuel you have left in your tank, whether the car is stopping for a
                    pedestrian etc. We also wanted the car to make sounds with their surroundings. For instance, when
                    the car is stopping for a pedestrian, it should say “After you sir” or something similar. That way,
                    the pedestrian would feel safe to walk over instead of freaking out by the thought that there is no
                    driver inside the car.
                </p>

                <p class="flow-text">To make a demonstration of this, we recorded a video. In the video, we are cutting
                    the scenes in
                    order to make the illusion of the car being an autonomous car.</p>

                    the car that will communicate what the car is about to do or what the pedestrian can do.
                    A cardboard car front was built and used to make two stop motion movies that showed how the lights
                    could possibly work.

                    The light on the front will always be lit to show that it works. When a pedestrian is perceived it
                    will turn green, it will start braking and therefore a fluent line of red lights will ascend from
                    the middle green light showing how much the car is braking. When the car is near the crosswalk and
                    is about to completely stop the red brake lights will turn green, showing to the pedestrian it is
                    safe to walk.

                <p class="flow-text">This movie shows the car when it is turning on an intersection. The blue light from
                    the middle will move towards, in this case, the right of the car since it is about to turn to the
                    right. The light will ‘predict’ the cars movement, by moving in advance of the car.</p>

            </div>
        </div>
        <p class="flow-text">
            We showed these movies to some people, solely asking them what they think the car is communicating with
            them. An interesting result was that it is confusing that the car sometimes shows what the car will do and
            sometimes what it expects the pedestrian to do. Due to this, one participant thought that the car would
            start driving again after the lights turned green in the first movie, since in both movies the car is
            communicating what the car is doing. Also the sudden change of the colours of the light seems to confuse and
            shock the pedestrians. Though, the participants do believe that the lights could be a good way to show what
            the car will do, and therefore give them more trust in it.
            More testing about how the lights have to appear in order to communicate in an intuitive way should be
            conducted to create a safe concept.

                    Tested by duck taping two phones to the back of a chair.
                    Depends on the material in the seat (leading the vibrations). It is possible to communicate by
                    vibrations. It is important to have the right material and part the sources of vibrations (so not
                    everything starts shaking). Can communicate by placement and strength of vibration. </p>

                    Tilting the back: Feels like a comfortable way to be aware, but it does not provide much
                    information.
                    It is not a “stand alone solution”. A possible way of communicating can be by the “speed” the back
                    are adjusted. Pushing the seat forward can help enhance the feeling of speeding, and might prevent
                    people from breaking speed limits.</p>

                    human (driver) while driving. Possible solution in cars today. (The car should not give more than
                    small indications; big movements can create dangerous situations).

                <p class="grey-text text-lighten-4">This project was developed in conjunction with the course TMM4220 at NTNU.
                    Each team, consisting of 8 to 16 students, was given a design challenge. Our challenge was “redefining the autonomous driving experience”, and needed to be tackled using the Design Thinking method. This method can be divided into three different phases: empathizing, ideation and prototyping. We gained insights and new perspectives through empathizing (interviewing and talking) with different stakeholders. By ideating (defining a point-of-view and brainstorming) using our newfound insights we were able to come up with ideas to solutions. These ideas were  divided into core concepts: sound, light, touch and screen. Our prototypes were based on these core concepts and the different ideas underlying these concepts.</p>
